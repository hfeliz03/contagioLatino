## About

ContagioLatino was the official website for the University of Massachusetts Amherst organization, Contagio Latino—a club co-founded by my friends and myself to "spread" Latin culture across campus. The organization continues to thrive, bringing together the UMass community through music, dance, art, and celebration of Latinx heritage.

- **Mission:** To spread Latin culture by hosting events, performances, and workshops that celebrate the diversity, vibrancy, and joy of Latin America.
- **Activities:** Club meetings, dance workshops, music events, cultural showcases, and collaborations with other student groups.
